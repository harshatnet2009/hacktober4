There’s no escaping the PUBG craze. It’s one of the most-talked about and perhaps one of the most-played games at the moment. For the uninitiated, PUBG or PlayerUnknown Battlegrounds is a real-time multiplayer shooter game launched last year by PUBG corporation and China's Tencent games. The game is based on PlayerUnkown Ghost Hotel Battle Royal game and includes too many controls and activities such as landing from the parachute, collecting the weapons and armours as well as killing and surviving from the enemies, which makes it quite a task to manage them on our smartphone screens using the touchscreen.
